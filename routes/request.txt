We are tasked with solving a system of linear equations to determine the values of two variables, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). This problem is designed to test your understanding of algebraic manipulation and substitution or elimination methods. Consider the following system of equations, which we will solve step by step. The first equation involves a simple linear relationship, while the second introduces a fractional term to add a slight twist to the problem. The system is given by:\\n\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n2x + 3y &= 7 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\frac{x}{2} - y &= 1\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n\\nTo further explore the context of this problem, imagine that these equations represent a real-world scenario, such as balancing quantities in a mixture or financial planning. While solving, you might also consider the determinant of the coefficient matrix to check if a unique solution exists. The coefficient matrix for this system is:\\n\\n\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\n2 & 3 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\frac{1}{2} & -1\\n\\\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\nAdditionally, letâ€™s think about the graphical interpretation: the solution represents the intersection point of two lines. For extra practice, you can verify the solution by substituting back into the original equations or by considering the expression \\( (2x + 3y)^2 - (7)^2 \\) to see if it equals zero at the solution point. Solve the system and express your answer as the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).
