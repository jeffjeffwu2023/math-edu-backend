Your task is to find the values of the variables that satisfy all given conditions. We will explore this through a step-by-step approach, incorporating various mathematical expressions to enrich the problem context.\\n\\nIn the first part, consider the following system of equations involving fractions and exponents. Solve for the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the equations below:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{2x}{3} + \\\\frac{y}{4} = \\\\frac{5}{6}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{x}{2} - \\\\frac{3y}{5} = -\\\\frac{1}{10}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nTo provide additional context, imagine this system represents a scenario where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are quantities adjusted by fractional coefficients. As a supplementary challenge, note that the expression \\(x^2 + y^2\\) might be useful for verification, though it is not required for the solution. Furthermore, consider a matrix representation of the system for conceptual understanding (not necessary for solving):\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\n\\\\frac{2}{3} & \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\frac{1}{2} & -\\\\frac{3}{5}\\n\\\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\nx \\\\\\\\\\ny\\n\\\\end{bmatrix}\\n=\\n\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\n\\\\frac{5}{6} \\\\\\\\\\n-\\\\frac{1}{10}\\n\\\\end{bmatrix}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nIn the second part, letâ€™s think about the implications of the solution. Suppose the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are used to evaluate a more complex expression, such as the integral of a function (for conceptual purposes only, not required for solving):\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int_{0}^{1} (x t + y)^2 \\\\, dt\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis integral represents a theoretical extension and is not part of the core problem. Your main goal remains to solve the original system of equations. Provide the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfy both equations, ensuring all steps are clear and accurate. Use algebraic methods suitable for an easy difficulty level, such as substitution or elimination, to find the solution."}'}}]
